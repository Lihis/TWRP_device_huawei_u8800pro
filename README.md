Twrp 2.7.1.0 device tree (4.4.3)

WIP By Desalesouche(NoGiveUp-FR) from xDA...


Bug:power off not working---> when pressed:device freeze, the rest seem good...

charging animation == fixed + no more reboot in recovery  xD


Credits go to Forumber cos i have been inspired a lot from his work...
           to Dazzozo cos his huawei device tree helped somehow for fixing charging animation and reboot to recovery.
           to TeamWinRecoveryProject
              Myself
